# Flutter Codes

This repository contains Flutter code written during mobile development classes at university.  
The goal of these lessons was to explore the fundamentals of cross-platform mobile development using Flutter and Dart.

The code includes basic UI components, navigation, layout structures, and simple interaction logic â€” all built during my academic learning process.  
These exercises were part of my first contact with mobile programming, helping me understand how Flutter apps are structured and how widgets interact.

> This repository reflects my practical foundation in mobile app development using Flutter.
